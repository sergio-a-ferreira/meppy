# meppy
a python framework to support the *[Euler Project](https://projecteuler.net/)* problems resolution; providing an environment to document, test, benchmark and log the algorithms used.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Prerequisites

Python 3.8.2

meppy was developed over Python 3.8.2, and backward compability is not guaranted.
We will update version compatibility as we test against older versions.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
